#  StackPortfol.io

StackPortfol.io is a platform that allows Developers to add showcase their projects and associate them with the skills that they used to create them. Since the skills are linked to projects, Recruiters have peace of mind that the Developers they are contacting have the skills that they say they have.

## Planning Phase

###  Site objective

While Developers can use a site such as LinkedIn to add projects, the architecture is set to to serve the needs of a number of different job functions. Due to the fact that the site us not focused on Developers, the project showcase lacks many features that Developers need. Recruiters who are searching for Developers for role lack the evidence that a Developer has the skills for which they are searching. In many cases, a skill might be added to a professional profile just because someone has heard or watched a video about it.

StackPortfol.io allows Developers to showcase their projects, which then allows Recruiters to find Developers who have proven skills for their job postings. It's a win-win for both parties.

###  Opportunities

Being a Developer myself, I have a lot of feature ideas for the Stackportfol.io platform. I have listed them in the table below, rating them by their importance and difficulty. The rating system is based on the MoSCoW method of prioritisation.

### Entity Relationship Diagram

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created using [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). The ERD is a visual representation of the database structure. It shows the tables, the columns in each table, and the relationships between the tables.
