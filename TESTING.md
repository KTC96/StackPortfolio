# Testing

[Click here to go back to the README.md file](README.md)

## Overview

I am using a combination of automated and manual testing in my project. I also use different tools for validating the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python code. In this testing file, I have also included the performance checks from Google Lighthouse.

## Validation

### HTML

I use the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate my HTML code.

With Django, theres a lot of syntax that doesn't play well with the HTML Validator, such as `{% url 'homepage' %}` or `{{ variable|filter }}`.

Normally, I validate by using [validate by uri](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) by passing in my deployed URL. However, many pages on this site require a user to be logged-in and authenticated, and will not work using this method, due to the fact that the HTML Validator (W3C) doesn't have access to login to the pages.

In order to properly validate my HTML pages for authenticated pages, I followed these steps:

- Navigate to the deployed pages that require authentication
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select **View Page Source** (usually `CTRL+U` or `âŒ˜+U` on Mac).
- This will display the entire compiled code.
- Copy everything, and use the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) method.
- Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated.

### CSS

I use the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate my CSS code. However, there are a number of errors due to using Tailwind CSS on my project. The Jigsaw CSS Validator cannot handle some of the Tailwind Syntax and it throws errors whenever it sees a pseudoelement such as `::before` or `::after`, or a wildcard selector such as `*`. You can [click here to go to the Jigsaw CSS Validation for the site](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stackportfol.io%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=0&vextwarning=&lang=en). It turns out that the parsing of CSS variables is the cause. Here is a table of the errors (the repeated and some similar errors have been removed to avoid repetition):

| CSS                                                                            | Error                                                 | Description                                                                               | Reference                                                                                                |

| `::backdrop`                                                                   | `Parse Error`                                         | This error is also about the CSS Variables that Jigsaw cannot support                     |                                                                                                          |

| `:root .prose`                                                                 | `Parse Error )`                                       | This is also where CSS variables are being declared and can't be parsed by Jigsaw         |                                                                                                          |
| `.tooltip`                                                                     | `Parse Error [has(:focus-visible):after]`             | It looks like Jigsaw also has difficulty parsing `:has` or other newer pseudoselectors    |                                                                                                          |

The above shows that Jigsaw has trouble parsing CSS Variable, but also newer pdeudoselectors such as `:has`, `:where` and `:is`, which are all now fully supported in modern browsers:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has>
- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where>
- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is>

While these newer psudeoselectors have only received support recently, since my main target audience is developers, I am not too concerned about this. I will continue to use these newer selectors. I also saw that Firefox has mixed reports on whether this is fully supported, but when I tested the functionality where these selectors are used, it worked as expected.

### JavaScript

I used [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) to validate my JavaScript code. Here is a table of the validated code, which shows the file validated, a screenshot and a descriptionany warnings:

| File                    | Screenshot                                                                                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Python and Django (Pep 8)

## Performance

I used the Google Chrome Lighthouse tool to test the performance of my app. On both mobile and desktop, there were some common issues that I want to address here. These issues are largely related to Tailwind and Images, which I will be addressing in future. It was expected that I would have issues with user-provided images as I had less control over the size and format they provided. In the below table, I call these "standard issues":

1. `Eliminate render-blocking resources`, `Reduce initial server response time`, `Reduce unused CSS` and `Minify CSS` - These warnings are all related to the use of Tailwind on this project. Since this is my first project with Tailwind, I came up against some issues that I hadn't anticipated. One issue of these is that Tailwind does not add a class to the `tailwind.css` file if it is dynamically rendered or if it is "injected" from the `form.py` file. For this reason, I had to force-add some of the Tailwind classes so that the site appears as expected. This leads to a largeer CSS file, which is why I am getting these warnings. I am not too concerned about this, as I am using Tailwind for the first time and I am still learning how to use it. I will be able to optimise this further in the future, and apply another approach I learned on the project where I am able to use `widget_tweaks` to add the classes in the template file instead of the `forms.py` file. I also do not currently have a way to minify the CSS on the fly, which means the file being used in unminified. In the future, I will be adding a minification step to the deployment process.

2. `Largest Contentful Paint element` and `Properly size images` - These warnings are related to the images on the site. While I have been able to convert images to Webp, I did not have time to resize all the images so that the correct size is being used. I would like to do this in the future, but I am also considering changing from Cloudinary to AWS, so this is something that I will address in the future.

3. `Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy` - This warning is related to the fact that I am using Cloudinary to serve my static assets. This is handled by Cloudinary and I don't currently know how to change this. I will be looking into this in the future.

4. `Elements with visible text labels do not have matching accessible names.` - I get this error for accessibility for any of my cards with images and an `aria-label`. The error indicates that screen readers will have a confusing experience as the aria label does not match the inner text. However, I tested this with a screen reader and it works as expected, and even provides a better experience than if there were no aria label.

5. `Issues were logged in the Issues panel in Chrome Devtools` - This is a warning regarding the [phasing out of third-party cookies](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd). I will not be addressing this as a part of this project's sprints, but I will be looking into this in the future.

6. `Image elements do not have explicit width and height` - This is due to some issues with responsiveness, but I will be addressing these in the future. I understand this is good to have to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).

7. `Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order` is occurring on pages where there are no h2s, but there are always h3s in the footer.

Here are the results:
